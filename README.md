# Quicker Quick Movement - Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous mod

Allows you to change the speed multiplier given by the Quick Movement setting. Game default is 1.8, which I find to be too slow.

## Installation

1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).
3. Install [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases) with UMM (or the ModFinder).
4. Install [this mod](https://github.com/SirCxyrtyx/QuickerQuickMovement/releases/download/1.0.0/QuickerQuickMovement-1.0.0.zip) with UMM.

## Usage

Change the speed multiplier in Options -> Mods -> QuickerQuickMovement to whatever you want.
Make sure to enable Quick Movement in Options -> Game or this won't do anything.
